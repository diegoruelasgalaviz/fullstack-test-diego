# Aura Research Full Stack Technical Test

## Overview

This repository contains a full stack technical assessment for candidates applying to Aura Research. The project is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application that demonstrates your ability to work with modern web technologies in both frontend and backend development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this technical test is to evaluate your skills in:

1. **Full Stack Development**: Working with both frontend and backend technologies
2. **Clean Architecture**: Implementing domain-driven design principles
3. **TypeScript**: Using strong typing across the entire stack
4. **Testing**: Writing and running tests for both frontend and backend
5. **Database Design**: Working with relational databases and ORM tools

## Project Requirements

As a candidate, you are expected to:

1. **Understand the Existing Codebase**: Navigate and comprehend the architecture and patterns used
2. **Implement New Features**: Add functionality to both frontend and backend components
3. **Fix Bugs**: Identify and resolve any issues in the existing code
4. **Write Tests**: Ensure proper test coverage for your implementations
5. **Document Your Work**: Provide clear documentation of your changes and decisions

## Challenge Point System

This technical test uses a point-based evaluation system:

- Each challenge has a specific point value based on its business importance
- You must earn a minimum of 70 points to successfully complete the test
- You must complete at least one Critical priority challenge (30 points)
- You must complete at least one High priority challenge (20 points)
- The remaining points can be earned by completing any combination of challenges

### Challenge Priorities

Importantly, challenge priorities (Critical, High, Medium, Low) reflect **business value** rather than technical difficulty. A Critical priority challenge addresses a core business need, while a Low priority challenge, though still valuable, may have less immediate impact on business operations.

Detailed information about the point system can be found in the `POINT_SYSTEM.md` file, and each challenge file includes its point value in the title.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Vite as the build tool
- Vitest for testing

### Backend
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express for the web server
- TypeORM for database interactions
- PostgreSQL as the database
- JWT for authentication
- Clean Architecture principles

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

1. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-structured code
2. **Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns and adherence to clean architecture principles
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage and proper testing practices
4. **Problem Solving**: Ability to implement solutions to the given requirements
5. **Documentation**: Clear explanation of your approach and decisions

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow the setup instructions in the README.md
3. Familiarize yourself with the codebase
4. Complete the tasks outlined in the assignment document provided separately

## Submission Guidelines

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Implement your changes in the forked repository
3. Create a single Pull Request (PR) for all your changes
4. Your PR should include detailed explanations of:
   - What changes were made
   - Why these changes were implemented
   - How the implementation addresses the requirements
   - Any design decisions or trade-offs considered
5. Provide access to your forked repository to the Aura Research team
6. Include a summary document of your overall approach and key decisions

## Time Allocation

You are expected to spend approximately 4-6 hours on this test. We value quality over quantity, so focus on delivering well-structured and tested code rather than implementing all features if time is limited.

## Support

If you have any questions or need clarification about the test, please reach out to the Aura Research team at [contact email].

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your submission!
